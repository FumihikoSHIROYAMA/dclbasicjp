Step 1: Run the skeleton app
------

In this step, you open the source files, familiarize yourself with the Dart and HTML code, and run the app.

### Expand the 1-blankbadge directory.
In Dart Editor, expand the *1-blankbadge* directory by clicking the little arrow wee arrow to the left of its name. The directory contains two files, *piratebadge.html* and *piratebadge.dart*.

### Open the files.
Open both files, *piratebadge.html* and *piratebadge.dart*, by double-clicking each filename in Dart Editor.

### Review the code.
Get familiar with the HTML and the Dart code for the skeleton version of the app.

#### piratebadge.html
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Pirate badge</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../piratebadge.css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Pirate badge</h1>
        
        <div class="widgets">
          TO DO: Put the UI widgets here.
        </div>
        <div class="badge">
          <div class="greeting">
            Arrr! Me name is
          </div>
          <div class="name">
            <span id="badgeName"> </span>
          </div>
        </div>
    
        <script type="application/dart" src="piratebadge.dart"></script>
        <script src="packages/browser/dart.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>

#### Key Information

* During this code lab, all the changes you make to *piratebadge.html* are within the <div> element identified with the class *widgets*.
* In later steps, the <span> element with the ID *badgeName* is programmatically updated by the Dart code based on user input.
* The first <script> tag identifies the main file that implements the app. Here, it’s the *piratebadge.dart* file.
* The Dart Virtual Machine (Dart VM) runs Dart code natively. The Dart VM is built into Dartium, a special build of the Chromium browser in which you can run Dart apps natively.
* The *packages/browser/dart.js* script checks for native Dart support and either bootstraps the Dart VM or loads compiled JavaScript instead.

#### piratebadge.dart

    void main() {
      // Your app starts here.
    }

* This file contains the entry point for the app—the *main()* function. The <script> tags in the *piratebadge.html* file start the application by running this function.
* The *main()* function is a top-level function.
* A top-level variable or function is one that is declared outside a class definition.

### Run the app.

To run the app in Dart Editor, select *piratebadge.html* and click the Run button.

Dart Editor launches *Dartium*, a special build of Chromium that has the Dart Virtual Machine built in, and loads the *piratebadge.html* file. The *piratebadge.html* file loads the app and calls the main() function.

You should see a TO DO comment on the left and a red and white name badge on the right.
