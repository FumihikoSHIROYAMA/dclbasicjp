Step 7: Go forth and learn more about Dart
-----

### Think about what you’ve done!

This code lab provided a tour of most Dart language features and many library features. Here’s where to go to learn more.

#### The Dart language

[A Tour of the Dart Language](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch02.html) shows you how to use each major Dart feature, from variables and operators to classes and libraries. This code lab introduced the following Dart language features, all of which are covered in more detail in the language tour.

* string interpolation (*'$_firstName the $_appellation'*)
* the cascade operator (*..*)
* the fat arrow (*=>*) function syntax
* the ternary operator (*?:*)
* named constructors (*PirateName.fromJSON(...)*)
* optional parameters
* a class
* getters
* instance methods and fields
* class level methods and fields
* top-level variables and functions
* typecasting with *as* (*(e.target as InputElement)*)
* import, and import with *show* (*import 'dart:math' show Random;*)
* generics

#### The Dart libraries

[A Tour of the Dart Libraries](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html) shows you how to use the major features in Dart’s libraries.
